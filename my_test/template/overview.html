        <h1>Blood Donation Overview</h1>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Blood donation is a voluntary procedure that can help save lives. There are several types of blood donation, each helping to meet different medical needs.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Types of Blood Donation</h2>
        <h3>1. Whole Blood Donation</h3>
        <p>Whole blood donation is the most common type of blood donation. During this donation, you donate about a pint (about half a liter) of whole blood. The blood is then separated into its components — red cells, plasma, and sometimes platelets.</p>

        <h3>2. Apheresis</h3>
        <p>During apheresis, you are hooked up to a machine that collects and separates different parts of your blood, such as red cells, plasma, and platelets. The machine then returns the remaining parts of the blood back to you.</p>

        <h3>3. Platelet Donation (Plateletpheresis)</h3>
        <p>Platelet donation collects only platelets, which help stop bleeding by clumping and forming plugs in blood vessels. Donated platelets are commonly given to people with clotting problems, cancer, or those undergoing organ transplants or major surgeries.</p>

        <h3>4. Double Red Cell Donation</h3>
        <p>This type of donation allows you to donate a concentrated amount of red blood cells, which deliver oxygen to your organs and tissues. Donated red blood cells are typically given to people with severe blood loss or anemia.</p>

        <h3>5. Plasma Donation (Plasmapheresis)</h3>
        <p>Plasma donation collects the liquid portion of the blood, which helps with clotting and contains antibodies to fight infections. Plasma is commonly given to people in emergency and trauma situations.</p>

        <h2>Why Donate Blood?</h2>
        <p>Millions of people need blood transfusions each year. Some may need blood during surgery, while others depend on it after an accident or due to a disease. Blood donation makes all of this possible. There is no substitute for human blood — all transfusions use blood from a donor.</p>

        <h2>Eligibility Requirements</h2>
        <p>To be eligible to donate blood, you must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be in good health.</li>
            <li>Be at least 16 or 17 years old (depending on your state).</li>
            <li>Weigh at least 110 pounds (about 50 kilograms).</li>
            <li>Pass a physical and health-history assessment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Prepare</h2>
        <p>Before donating blood:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Get plenty of sleep the night before.</li>
            <li>Eat a healthy meal and avoid fatty foods.</li>
            <li>Drink plenty of water.</li>
            <li>Check if any medications you are taking would prevent you from donating.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <h3>Before the Procedure</h3>
        <p>You will fill out a confidential medical history form and undergo a brief physical exam, including a check of your blood pressure, pulse, and hemoglobin level.</p>

        <h3>During the Procedure</h3>
        <p>You will lie or sit in a reclining chair while a sterile needle is inserted into a vein in your arm. The process typically takes about 10 minutes for whole blood donation.</p>

        <h3>After the Procedure</h3>
        <p>After donating, you will rest in an observation area and have a light snack. You should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drink extra fluids.</li>
            <li>Avoid strenuous activity for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Keep the bandage on for at least 4 hours.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Risks and Safety</h2>
        <p>Blood donation is safe. New, sterile equipment is used for each donor, so there's no risk of contracting a bloodborne infection. Most healthy adults can donate blood without health risks.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Your blood will be tested for blood type, Rh factor, and bloodborne diseases. If the tests are negative, your blood will be distributed for use. If any tests are positive, you will be notified, and your donation will be discarded.</p>
